## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Hand Detection Module**:
   - Captures video input using a webcam.
   - Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe and tracks movements.

2. **Gesture Recognition Module**:
   - Maps hand gestures to mouse actions (e.g., left-click, right-click, drag, scroll).

3. **Voice Command Module** (Optional):
   - Recognizes voice inputs to execute commands.

4. **Execution**:
   - Integrates gesture and voice inputs to control the virtual mouse.
